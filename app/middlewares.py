"""
Custom middleware for logging request lifecycle metrics with correlation IDs.

This module defines `LoggingMiddleware`, which logs:
- HTTP method
- Path
- Status code
- Response time (ms)
- Unique request ID (from correlation ID or fallback UUID)

Logs are JSON-structured and emitted to the central logger under "router".

ðŸ§  Purpose:
- Enable traceable observability across distributed systems
- Improve debugging, performance analysis, and error root cause tracking
- Integrate smoothly with log aggregation services like ELK, CloudWatch, etc.

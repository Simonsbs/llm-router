"""
Security middleware to inject basic HTTP headers for added protection.

Currently implements a `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP) header to restrict
content sources to the application‚Äôs own origin (`'self'`), reducing the risk
of XSS attacks in browser environments.

This middleware:
- Applies security headers to all routes
- Skips Swagger and Redoc docs routes to avoid breaking their UI

üõ°Ô∏è Note: This is not a full security suite. CSP is a helpful addition,
but you may still want tools like Helmet (Node), ModSecurity, or AWS WAF for full protection.

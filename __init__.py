# __init__.py

"""
Root package initializer for the SimonGPT repository.

This file marks the top-level directory as a Python package,
even if no logic is included here.

ðŸ“¦ Why it exists:
- Ensures compatibility with Python tooling that expects packages.
- Enables relative imports like `from app.main import app`.
- Helps IDEs and type checkers like MyPy understand package scope.

In this case, the root folder doesn't expose public interfaces,
so the file is intentionally left empty.
